This mod, created for Modfest, adds the gods Zeus and Poseidon, who represent the sky and ocean respectively. **You can make friends with them and receive encouragement from them, or anger them and be punished.**

# Usage
Here you will find Zeus and Poseidon, gods of the sky and sea. When you first join, you will have 7 reputation points from the two gods, with a maximum of 15.

# Gameplay

### Zeus

If you become a raider and have less than 5 reputation points, you will face the wrath of Zeus.

To gain respect from Zeus, you must either kill raiders or sacrifice a sheep in the windswept hills. If you have a reputation of more than 12, you will receive his thanks. Additionally, you can find his statue in the hills and obtain his lightning by clicking on the statue with a netherite sword in your hand (you should have maximum respect from Zeus).

### Poseidon

If you want to witness Poseidon's wrath, you should kill dolphins, turtles, or horses (he likes them). His wrath will be evident when your reputation is less than 5.

To gain Poseidon's respect, eliminate any zombies in the world. Similar to Zeus, Poseidon can also be worshipped by finding his statue at the bottom of the sea. To obtain Poseidon's trident, simply click on it while holding your own trident (and ensure you have maximum respect from Poseidon).
